## Preparing for master's exams

I'm focused on successfully completing my first semester, with exams in June. A lot of studying is happening!

## Learning Python

I'm learning Python and diving into the basics of Machine Learning, working on small projects to solidify my understanding. I hope that Python will be a language that I will like more than C#.

I read a book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow](Hands-On%20Machine%20Learning%20with%20Scikit-Learn,%20Keras%20and%20TensorFlow.md) and after first three chapters I feel like I understand nothing.

## Finishing Nitrodigest

I'm continuing to improve Nitrodigest, my CLI tool for summarizing text. I'm working on documentation and examples to make it more useful.
