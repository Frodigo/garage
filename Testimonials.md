Marcin is a significant part of the success of the Magento/Adobe community and our work with PWA Studio and Venia. Marcin delivered our essential desktop experience for PWA in early 2021, which addressed a top customer need. He is a regular contributor in our community and continues to create content and examples for others to get started, which is highly appreciated. Beyond the work itself, Marcin is always open to feedback and serves as a model for open source contribution. We're grateful for his help and support!

Working with Marcin was a delight, and I truly hope that this was only one in many more opportunities to come in the near future. He is a talented Frontend Engineer (with strong UX and programming things understanding) and inspirational Team Leader, always willing to take on any task or help others with theirs. He is also a great communicator, collaborator, and extremely passionate about what he is doing.

I highly recommend working with Marcin on architecture topics. Each meeting was filled to the brim with substantial knowledge. From each session, I also took away a handful of materials for review. I'm definitely signing up for the second edition of Architecture with Marcin!

I had the pleasure to work with Marcin, and he is pure talent both in terms of technical and soft skills. He is always a committed and trusted member of a team. He amazed me with his problem-solving attitude and how proactive he is. Marcin is constantly looking for new things to learn and bring new ideas to the project. If you are looking for a guy that can solve any problem on the frontend, Marcin is that guy!
