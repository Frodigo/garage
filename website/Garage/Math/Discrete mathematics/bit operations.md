- **XOR (Exclusive OR)** - A fundamental operation in DES, returning 1 only when exactly one of the operands equals 1.
- **Bit Shifts** - Moving all bits left or right by a specified number of positions (used in subkey generation).
- **Permutation** - Rearranging bits according to a specific pattern without changing their values.
- **Substitution** - Replacing one set of values with another according to a specific rule (S-boxes in DES).
