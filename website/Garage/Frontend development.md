Learning roadmap for anyone who want to learn frontend development.

Frontend development focuses on implementing the visual and interactive elements of websites and applications that users directly engage with. It encompasses the creation of user interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks and tools to build responsive, accessible, and performant web experiences that work across different devices and browsers.

## Key Aspects of Frontend Development

1. User interface implementation
2. Responsive and adaptive design
3. Browser compatibility management
4. Performance optimization
5. Accessibility implementation
6. Interactive behavior programming
7. Visual design translation
8. State management
9. API integration and data presentation
10. User experience optimization

## Key Definitions

1. **DOM (Document Object Model)**: Interface that treats HTML documents as tree structures where each node is an object representing a part of the document
2. **Responsive Design**: Approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes
3. **Framework**: Pre-written code that provides a structured foundation for building applications
4. **Component**: Reusable, self-contained piece of code that encapsulates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a specific UI element
5. **Transpilation**: Process of converting source code from one programming language to another
6. **Bundling**: Process of combining multiple code files into a single file
7. **Minification**: Process of removing unnecessary characters from code without changing functionality
8. **Polyfill**: Code that implements a feature on web browsers that do not support it
9. **API (Application Programming Interface)**: Set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software
10. **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)**: Technique for creating asynchronous web applications
11. **Render**: Process of displaying content on a screen
12. **Virtual DOM**: Programming concept where a virtual representation of the DOM is kept in memory and synced with the real DOM
13. **CSS Preprocessor**: Scripting language that extends CSS and is compiled into regular CSS
14. **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content as the user interacts
15. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Website that looks and behaves like a mobile app
16. **Web Components**: Set of web platform APIs that allow creating custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags
