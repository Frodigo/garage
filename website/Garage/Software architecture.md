## Key Definitions

1. **Architecture**: The fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships, and the principles governing its design and evolution
2. **Component**: A modular part of a system with a well-defined interface that encapsulates behavior and data
3. **Connector**: A mechanism that mediates communication, coordination, or cooperation among components
4. **Module**: A unit of implementation that provides a coherent set of functionality
5. **Interface**: A boundary across which components interact
6. **Quality Attribute**: A measurable or testable property of a system used to indicate how well it satisfies stakeholder needs
7. **Architectural Pattern**: A general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture
8. **Architectural Style**: A family of architectures that share certain characteristics
9. **Architectural View**: A representation of a set of system elements and their relationships
10. **Architectural Decision**: A choice that affects the structure, behavior, or qualities of a software system
11. **Architectural Tactic**: A design decision that influences the control of a quality attribute response
12. **Reference Architecture**: A template architecture for systems in a particular domain
13. **Technical Debt**: The implied cost of additional work caused by choosing an expedient solution instead of a better approach
14. **Decomposition**: Breaking a complex system into smaller, more manageable parts
15. **Coupling**: The degree of interdependence between software modules
16. **Cohesion**: The degree to which elements within a module belong together
