The most important folder is a Garage folder where I keep all the knowledge. I am interested in these things (and wanna write about them).

I divided the content into a learning roadmap that helps me organize my learning paths and projects into simple to-do lists.
Here are my learning roadmaps:

- [[Garage/Machine learning|Machine learning]]
- [[Cybersecurity]]
- [[Database Systems and MySQL]]
- [[Internet of things]]
- [[Programming for Kids]]
- [[Product Development]]

Actually, you may ask why I write this content?
