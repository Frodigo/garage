many modern computers don’t have command-line at all

- Corporations force people to use prepared marketplaces app stores
- new no-code approach replaces programmers (side note - also AI)
- cli allows you to see how things really work
- You can interact with computer at level much more deeper than any GUI offer
- Some time ago editor was in terminal
- Now terminal is a feature in editor
- Fundamental principles of good CLI design:
  - human-first
  - simple programs with clean interfaces can be combined into larger systems
  - Programs must be modular enough to be combined
  - Making programs composable is just as important as ever
  - people will use your software in a way you can’t even imagine
  - Where possible, a CLI should follow patterns that already exist.
  - Command should say not too much but at least something that user believes it’s working
  - Programs must be easy to discover for users, intuitive
  - In terminal user has a conversation with the program
