## Key Definitions

1. **Computational Thinking**: The thought process of formulating problems and solutions in ways that computers can execute
2. **Block-Based Programming**: Coding using visual blocks that snap together, eliminating syntax errors
3. **Sequence**: The order in which instructions are executed in a program
4. **Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task
5. **Loop**: A programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions
6. **Conditional Statement**: A programming feature that performs different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false
7. **Variable**: A storage location paired with an associated name that contains a value
8. **Function/Procedure**: A reusable section of code that performs a specific task
