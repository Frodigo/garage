- obsidian RSS doesn't work properly - it's simple, it has only title and links
- but i needed titles, dates and content
- needed to create own script to generate RSS
- because obsidian doesn't support what i needed
- needed to create a cloudflare page and upload there a feed.xml
- needed to configure domains
