## Teaching My Son to Program

My son has repeatedly asked me what I do in my work, so I showed him some code and a few simple things, and he caught on. He got his first personal computer from me: a Raspberry Pi 500. I showed him how to use it and what he can do with it, and we're learning Python together.

## Getting Started at Docplanner and Learning .NET and C #

At the beginning of the year, I changed jobs and in my new role I'm dealing with technologies that are new to me. I'm trying to jump on this train and write software in C#. I started by reading "Learn C# in one day and learn it well" book. I'm working through a course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-csharp-masterclass) while practicing this new knowledge at work. At the same time, I'm also getting onboarded at Docplanner Tech where I joined as a Full Stack Software Engineer and I'm seeing lots of new things and meeting new people. Wonderful times!

## Getting Back to Running

For most of last year, I couldn't run which was quite painful for me. Physically, I gained significant weight, and mentally, I really missed it. Now I'm making up for lost time and getting back in shape. I'm training three times a week and I'm happy to be returning to form!

## Want to Be a Hero at Home

We're renovating our kitchen. We ordered new furniture and appliances, and I want to rewire the electricity and lay new tiles on the wall with my own hands. I'm in the preparation phase. The serious work starts soon!
