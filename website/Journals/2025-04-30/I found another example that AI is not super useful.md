Yesterday I designed a CLI commands structure for my project #NitroDigest and I asked AI for review. It loved my design + proposed some improvements. Do you think I accepted them?

Of course I did. Then I received a feedback from a real person and immediately realized I fell into over-engineering trap. My CLI could be 80% simpler. What did AI think about this?

Obviously it agreed, because AI is the yes-man who feeds your ego.
