### Goals

- [x] #NitroDigest read and answer in discussion about OOP: [https://github.com/Frodigo/garage/discussions/64]
- [x] #NitroDigest research about chunked prompts [https://github.com/Frodigo/garage/issues/97]
- [x] #Garage add info about NitroDigest project to the [[Now]] page

### Notes

- Worked on [this issue](https://github.com/Frodigo/garage/issues/97) and tried to create a working prototype with Cursor, but it was no able to handle this
  - it forces using tiktoken to count tokens in texts but it is not a good option for Llama models
  - boilerplate code was ok, but chunks were not created correctly
  - it tries stupid solution like: adding "safety margin with 1500 tokens to be sure that chunk size will be ok"
- next steps and open questions:
  - is there any library that can help with counting tokens for Llama models?
  - implement code responsible for create chunks.
  - Added diagrams to the issue

### Challenges & solutions

- #NitroDigest prompt that is sent to Ollama, often is to long and Ollama truncates it which has an impact on summary quality
  - solution: split text into chunks
  - problem 1:
    - how to count tokens in text?
      - tiktoken
        - but it's designed for OpenAI models, not for Olama
        - solution: for now I added simple code that count tokens based on model configuration.
  - problem 2:
    - how to split text into sentences?
      - why?
        - I need to create chunks and do not split text in the middle of word
        - Chunk needs to make sanse
        - to implement overlap in chunks
      - solution: NLTK
