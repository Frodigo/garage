### Goals

- [x] design a CLI structure for #NitroDigest

### Notes

- Created a very-first design of NitroDigest CLI and started a [discussion](https://github.com/Frodigo/garage/discussions/119)
- maybe someone will leave some comments and give some feedback
- I received comments from @Nestak - many thanks!
- Thanks to feedback I have an idea how to simplify my tool a lot

### Challenges & solutions

- I fFeel into overengineering trap when designing a cli for nitrodigest
  - solution: talked with @Nestak and thanks to that simplified the solution
	  - In fact, this tool can be simplified to two use cases:

```shell
nitrodigest  <file_text>  # make summary of text file
nitrodigest <directory with text files> # make a summary of files in a specific directory
```
