Hello!

My name is Marcin Kwiatkowski.

I am a full-stack **software engineer**, based in **Poland**. I solve problems with code since 2013. Almost all of my career I was working in the eCommerce area where I specialized in Magento.

Recently, I joined Docplanner and I help to make healthcare more human.

Besides engineering, I write articles on my blog and on Medium. Outside work I am a father, a husband and a runner.

I’m glad you came to my website. I hope you find something for yourself here.

## Knowledge base

From many years I have been working blog. Actually I experimented with different type of content. What I discovered in this journey? Writing technical articles and tutorials is my favorite type of writing.

Based on that, I write for people like me: engineers, programmers and learners.

But sometimes I want to write stories, or content that is doesn't strictly related with engineering. This type of writing you can find on my Medium blog.

Besides articles, I am a notetaker. All notes related to enginering I publish here and I name this type of content as "Manuals".

## What do people say about me?

Marcin is a significant part of the success of the Magento/Adobe community and our work with PWA Studio and Venia. Marcin delivered our essential desktop experience for PWA in early 2021, which addressed a top customer need. He is a regular contributor in our community and continues to create content and examples for others to get started, which is highly appreciated. Beyond the work itself, Marcin is always open to feedback and serves as a model for open source contribution. We're grateful for his help and support!

**Eric Erway, Group Product Manager, Adobe**

Working with Marcin was a delight, and I truly hope that this was only one in many more opportunities to come in the near future. He is a talented Frontend Engineer (with strong UX and programming things understanding) and inspirational Team Leader, always willing to take on any task or help others with theirs. He is also a great communicator, collaborator, and extremely passionate about what he is doing.

**Bartosz Picho, Engineering Director, Vaimo**

I highly recommend working with Marcin on architecture topics. Each meeting was filled to the brim with substantial knowledge. From each session, I also took away a handful of materials for review. I'm definitely signing up for the second edition of Architecture with Marcin!

**Przemysław Korościk, Engineering Manager, Monogo**

I had the pleasure to work with Marcin, and he is pure talent both in terms of technical and soft skills. He is always a committed and trusted member of a team. He amazed me with his problem-solving attitude and how proactive he is. Marcin is constantly looking for new things to learn and bring new ideas to the project. If you are looking for a guy that can solve any problem on the frontend, Marcin is that guy!
