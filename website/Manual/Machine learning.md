## Key Definitions

1. **Dataset**: Collection of data points used for machine learning tasks
2. **Training Set**: Portion of the dataset used to train the model
3. **Test Set**: Portion of the dataset used to evaluate model performance
4. **Sample/Example**: Individual data point in the dataset
5. **Features**: Input variables or attributes used for prediction
6. **Labels**: Output variables or targets the model aims to predict
7. **Model**: Mathematical representation that learns patterns from data
8. **Accuracy**: Measure of how well the model's predictions match actual values
9. **Precision**: Ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions
10. **Recall**: Ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positives
11. **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
12. **Overfitting**: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise
13. **Underfitting**: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns
14. **Bias**: Error from incorrect assumptions in the learning algorithm
15. **Variance**: Error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set
16. **Cross-validation**: Technique to evaluate model performance using multiple data splits
