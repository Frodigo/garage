- A piece of secret information used to control encryption and decryption operations
- Acts as the mathematical input that drives the encryption algorithm
- Usually a sequence of random or pseudo-random bits
- Must be protected and kept secret for the security system to work
- In symmetric encryption (like DES), the same key is used for both encryption and decryption
