A cryptographic method that uses multiple substitution alphabets to encrypt plaintext.

In [[Monoalphabetic rotation ciphers]] each letter in the [[Plaintext]] is always substituted with the same letter in [[Ciphertext]]
In a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, substitution depends on the position of the letter and a key.

This makes polyalphabetic substitution ciphers more secure.
