Cybersecurity encompasses the technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect systems, networks, devices, and data from cyber attacks, unauthorized access, and digital threats.

## Key Aspects of Cybersecurity

1. Information security
2. Network security
3. Application security
4. Operational security
5. Identity and access management
6. Incident response
7. Disaster recovery
8. Security awareness and training

## Key Definitions

1. **Threat**: Potential for a malicious actor or event to exploit vulnerabilities
2. **Vulnerability**: Weakness in a system that can be exploited by threats
3. **Risk**: Potential for loss, damage, or destruction as a result of a threat exploiting a vulnerability
4. **Attack Vector**: Path or means by which an attacker can gain access to a system
5. **Exploit**: Software or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability
6. **Malware**: Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access
7. **Social Engineering**: Psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes
8. **Encryption**: Process of encoding information to prevent unauthorized access
9. **Authentication**: Verification of identity before granting access
10. **Authorization**: Determination of permissions after authentication
11. **Defense in Depth**: Layered security approach to protect information
12. **Security Control**: Safeguard to avoid, detect, counteract, or minimize security risks
13. **Perimeter Security**: Protection at the boundary of a network
14. **Zero Trust**: Security model that assumes no implicit trust within or outside a network
15. **Data Breach**: Incident where sensitive information is exposed to unauthorized parties
16. **Security Posture**: Overall security status of an organization's systems and networks
