## Level 0: Understand the big picture

**Goal:** Learn what makes teaching programming to kids unique.

### Topics

- Why teach programming to kids?
- What is computational thinking?
- Age-appropriate cognitive development
- Key learning styles and inclusive teaching

### Mini-projects

- Create a visual map of age-appropriate skills
- Summarize key differences between teaching adults vs. children
- Observe a kids coding class on YouTube and take notes

## Level 1: Explore block-based programming

**Goal:** Learn the most popular platforms used by kids (e.g., Scratch, Blockly, Code.org).

### Topics

- Block-based programming concepts (sequence, loop, condition)
- Teaching with Scratch or Code.org
- Events, variables, simple functions

### Mini-projects

- Make a Scratch project that teaches loops
- Create a "Choose your adventure" story with blocks
- Record yourself explaining a project as you would to a 7-year-old

---

## Level 2: Teach with physical and visual tools

**Goal:** Learn how to introduce robotics and physical computing in kid-friendly ways.

### Topics

- Educational robots (micro:bit, LEGO SPIKE, Dash & Dot)
- Intro to sensors, LEDs, motors, and button events
- Use of unplugged (offline) coding activities

### Mini-projects

- Design a beginner lesson plan using micro:bit MakeCode
- Build a simple line-following robot with kids
- Create a board game version of conditionals or loops

---

## Level 3: Design your first lessons

**Goal:** Create lessons or workshops for different age groups.

### Topics

- Scaffolded instruction & inquiry-based learning
- Project-based and creative computing
- Setting clear learning objectives and outcomes

### Mini-projects

- Write a one-hour lesson for ages 7–9 and another for ages 10–12
- Use Bloom’s taxonomy to define your outcomes
- Collect feedback on your lesson from friends, teachers, or kids

---

## Level 4: Introduce text-based programming

**Goal:** Learn how to help kids transition from blocks to Python or JavaScript.

### Topics

- Bridging Scratch to Python (e.g., using Trinket or Turtle)
- Teaching variables, input/output, basic loops with text
- Turtle graphics, PyGame Zero, p5.js for creative expression

### Mini-projects

- Build a simple Turtle drawing program
- Create a Python "Guess the number" game
- Write your first collaborative coding project on Replit

---

## Level 5: Emphasize thinking, not just syntax

**Goal:** Teach kids how to think like programmers.

### Topics

- Debugging and resilience
- Decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithmic thinking
- Code review and collaborative learning

### Mini-projects

- Facilitate a pair-programming challenge
- Run a “find the bug” game session
- Design a classroom poster of computational thinking strategies

---

## Level 6: Connect code to the real world

**Goal:** Use coding to integrate creativity, storytelling, and other school subjects.

### Topics

- Creative computing (music, animation, storytelling)
- Math + science + language arts integration
- Personalization and interest-based projects

### Mini-projects

- Create a Scratch game that teaches fractions
- Build a science quiz with Python
- Run a project showcase day

---

## Level 7: Inclusive, accessible, and global teaching

**Goal:** Reach and support all kinds of learners.

### Topics

- Culturally responsive teaching
- Neurodiversity and sensory considerations
- Socioeconomic and tech access issues

### Mini-projects

- Adapt one of your lessons for offline use
- Design activities that don’t require reading
- Create multilingual coding instructions

---

## Level 8: Mentor and empower young coders

**Goal:** Help kids grow into confident, independent makers.

### Topics

- Supporting independent projects
- Hosting code clubs, jams, and hackathons
- Encouraging community sharing and open source

### Mini-projects

- Guide a student in publishing their Scratch or Replit project
- Organize a mini coding jam for friends or a class
- Mentor a group in a global challenge (e.g., Hour of Code or CodeWeek)
