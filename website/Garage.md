Welcome in my garage. Here I store all my knowledge, notes, content, ideas etc.

## What uou can find here

- technical articles
- definitions
- concepts explantations
- tutorials
- and other thing that I can write

## Content structure

The best way to read content here is to use a navigation and explore content grouped by folders:

- [[Cybersecurity]]
- [[Cryptography]]
- [[Frontend]]
- [[Magento]]
- [[Math]]
- [[Software architecture]]
- [[Database Systems and MySQL]]
- [[Internet of things]]
- [[Garage/Machine learning|Machine learning]]
- [[Ethical Hacking]]
- [[Object-oriented programming]]
- [[Test-Driven Development with AI]]

Please note that these pages typically are categories. For example, where you go to [[Internet of things]] you can see that there is a contents.

This consents is my roadmap for writing content. My approach for writing looks like this:

1. I want to learn something like [[machine learing]]
2. I start from high-level to see what I need to learn. I divide a topic into parts:
    1. Key aspects
    2. Definitions
    3. Specific parts of topics like Machine Learning Algorithms, Machine learning pipeline etc.
3. I go step-by step to each item in the roadmap
4. I go deeper and deeper
5. In the end I should have a deep knowledge of topic

Actually, you may ask why I write this content?

## Why I write?

I am a notetaker. If I want to larn something I must write it down, rephrasing it. Actually I do not write this content because I think someone will read it. But when I publish it, you can read it and maybe it will help you somehow.

Anyway, you can learn with me and this is the best thing of writing any content that is most ambitious that movies with cats on TikTok.

If you a learner, technical and like to get to know why something works this way or that way, maybe you will find something usefull here.

## Featured content

I cannot recommend anything so far, because almost all here is in progress. Any content that I could recommend is about [[Magento]] and [[Frontend]], but I wrote these articles wto or three years later and theyt are outdated.

The most funny part is that I wrote about Magento PWA Studio and this framework is not existing anymore.

In following months I will write about [[Garage/Machine learning|Machine learning]], [[Cybersecurity]], [[Cryptography]] and [[Internet of things]] and I wish that then I will have a solid knowledge base here.

Let me explain what is the garage repository.

## Garage repository

All content you can see here is a part of my open source repository called with the same name - garage. You can find it here:

[https://github.com/Frodigo/garage](https://github.com/Frodigo/garage)

All code examples, tools, experiments etc. are there.

is open source and will be **open source forever.**

### You may ask: why I named code repository "garage"?

I like cars, especially classic ones. I wish I have a garage with some nice classic car like old Ford Mustang or BMW. But for now I have only a computer which allow me to do some things. I think that I do these things in the garage. My engineering garage.

I can do some things and no corporation is behind it. I am independent, I broadcast from a garage for people in other garages.

I am a craftsman. I learn by doing tinkering in my garage. I do not care about deadlines or profit. I can go to my garage when I want.

Recently I started learning Python and I really like the "Zen of Python". Inspired by it I created my own manifesto.

### The Zen of the Garage

- Independence over corporate backing
- Creation over consumption
- Process over perfection
- The journey matters more than the destination
- A garage is both a physical space and a state of mind
- Connected garages form stronger communities
- Classic inspiration fuels modern creation
- Freedom to tinker is freedom to think
- What begins in garages can change the world
- When in doubt, build it yourself
- Open source software over subscription-based products

## Medium blog

Besides this website I have also a blog on Medium. You can find it here:

[https://medium.com/@frodigo](https://medium.com/@frodigo)

My idea is to keep technical content on this website. On Medium I write less-technical content, stories, news etc.

## Changelog

[[Changelog]] is a place where I writer about changes, new content, new tools, experiments, books recommendations etc.
