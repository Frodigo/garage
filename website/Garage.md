Hello, my name is Marcin Kwiatkowski. Welcome in my garage!

If you want to read more about me, checkout the [[About]]
page.

All content you can see here is a part of my open source repository called with the same name - garage. You can find it here:

[https://github.com/Frodigo/garage](https://github.com/Frodigo/garage)

All code examples, tools, experiments etc. are there.

is open source and will be **open source forever.**

*You may ask: why I named code repository "garage"?*

I like cars, especially classic ones. I wish I have a garage with some nice classic car like old Ford Mustang or BMW. But for now I have only a computer which allow me to do some things. I think that I do these things in the garage. My engineering garage.

I can do some things and no corporation is behind it. I am independent, I broadcast from a garage for people in other garages.

I am a craftsman. I learn by doing tinkering in my garage. I do not care about deadlines or profit. I can go to my garage when I want.

Recently I started learning Python and I really like the "Zen of Python". Inspired by it I created my own manifesto.

### The Zen of the Garage

1. Independence over dependency
2. Creation over consumption
3. [[Progress over perfection]]
4. Open-source over closed-source
5. Honesty over marketing BS

## Why I write?

I am a notetaker. If I want to learn something I must write it down, rephrasing it. Actually I do not write this content because I think someone will read it. But when I publish it, you can read it and maybe it will help you somehow.

Anyway, you can learn with me and this is the best thing of writing any content that is most ambitious that movies with cats on TikTok.

If you a learner, technical and like to get to know why something works this way or that way, maybe you will find something useful here.

## Medium blog

Besides this website I have also a blog on Medium. You can find it here:

[https://medium.com/@frodigo](https://medium.com/@frodigo)

My idea is to keep technical content on this website. On Medium I write less-technical content, stories, news etc.
