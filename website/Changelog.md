[[Progress over perfection]]. This page reminds me about this value. In the past I wrote blog and I did care about beautiful images, perfect taglines and excerpts that will encourage someone to click on the link.

Now, I just write. I write for myself. When i get back to this page, I see my progress. When I am sad and see it, I feel better. When I feel good and see it. I feel better.

Pure and uncomplicated.
