## How many versions are there in Magento?

Usually, there is a division into two versions: Community (free version) and Enterprise (paid version). The enterprise version is not really called Magento anymore, but Adobe Commerce.

Regarding Magento Community, a fork of this version called Mage-OS is also available recently. It is a lightweight version of Magento maintained by the community.

In summary, there are versions of Magento available:

- Magento Community edition

- B2B for Adobe Commerce

## Why is Magento so expensive?

Magento enterprise edition is a platform dedicated to large enterprise customers. Whether it is expensive is a subjective opinion. Magento will be expensive for some and not for others. I think that for customers considering Magento enterprise, price is not the most important factor.

## What is the difference between the support of each version?

Magento community support includes support on Community Forums, Open Source, documentation, StackExchange, Reddit, Blogs, and many other groups. The official forum documentation can be found in Adobe Commerce. Despite this support, the Magento business edition has its own support. Magento commerce customers that paid for the license can, of course, count on support from Adobe.

## What is the feature coverage of the Magento enterprise edition in headless solutions?

PWA Studio has little support for Magento enterprise features; Vue Storefront for Magento is integrated with the Magento community edition, so you won't find support for enterprise features there.

In both cases, you have to take custom development into account. You should also bear in mind that Magento GraphQL API does not support all enterprise features.

## What is an alternative for Magento enterprise edition when I really want Magento?

Magento community edition is good for many clients, but Magento commerce offers many interesting features. So community vs enterprise edition is theoretically a hard choice, but not really at all when you start thinking about license cost. You may ask, is it worth the money? The answer is: it depends on your business! I think small businesses should consider the Magento community edition with some third-party solutions and modules from the marketplace that can cover missing Magento 2 enterprise edition features.

---

## Conclusion

Magento community edition is a great proposition for small businesses, while Magento enterprise is a good solution for large players.

Magento enterprise is distinguished by additional features that are not available in the community version and support.
