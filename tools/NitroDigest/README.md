# NitroDigest

A Python tool for automatically summarizing email newsletters using AI.

## Features

- Connect to IMAP email servers to retrieve unread newsletters
- Extract text content from HTML emails
- Summarize content using various AI models:
  - Claude (Anthropic)
  - ChatGPT (OpenAI)
  - Ollama (local models)
- Save summaries as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Command-line interface with various options

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Frodigo/garage
cd tools/NitroDigest
```

### Create a virtual environment

### Using venv

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate on Unix/macOS
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate on Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Using conda

```bash
# Create conda environment
conda create -n nitrodigest python=3.11

# Activate environment
conda activate nitrodigest
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Email credentials (required)
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-password-or-app-password
IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com

# AI API keys (at least one is required)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Ollama configuration (if you prefer to use ollama)
OLLAMA_MODEL=mistral
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
```

### Gmail Configuration

If you're using Gmail, you'll need to:

1. Enable IMAP in your Gmail settings. For personal accounts it is enabled already, and this option is not visible in settings.
2. Create an app password if you have 2-factor authentication enabled, or if your regular password is not working, and you get authentication errors when attempting to use NitroDigest.
   - Go to [app passwords settings](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
   - Add new "app" with whatever name you want, then generate the 16-character password. This password can now be used instead of your regular password.

## Ollama docker setup

Follow this guide if you want to run Ollama on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Sufficient disk space (at least 10GB recommended, ideally 20% of your total disk space)
- For optimal performance: At least 8GB of RAM
- Optional for enhanced performance: NVIDIA GPU with proper drivers (for GPU acceleration)

### Run Ollama on docker using predefined docker compose

In the `ollama` directory you can find a `docker-compose.ollama.yml` file which contains setup
for `Olama` and `Open WebUI`.

1. To start Ollama run:

```bash
cd ollama
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ollama.yml up
```

Note that first build could take some time (~10-20min - depending on the internet connection)

1. Access the Ollama API directly at [http://localhost:11434](http://localhost:11434) or the web interface at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:11434)

Note: make sure that you have correct configuration in the `.env` file like this:

```bash
# Ollama configuration
OLLAMA_API_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama2

# Summarizer selection (claude, chatgpt, ollama)
ACTIVE_SUMMARIZER=ollama
```

If so, you are ready to use NitroDigest with local Ollama

### Installing new models

If you want to install new models you have three options.

1. Update the Modelfile
2. Using the command line
3. Using the Web UI

#### Updating the Modelfile

1. Modify ollama/Modelfile and change model there.
2. Rebuild the container`

#### Using the command line

1. Access the Ollama container:

```bash
docker exec -it ollama /bin/bash
```

1. Pull a model:

```bash
ollama pull llama2
```

Replace "llama2" with any model you want to use (e.g., deepseek-r1, llava-phi3)

1. Run the model:

```bash
ollama run llama2
```

#### Using the Web UI

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
2. Create an account if prompted.
3. Go to the Models section and select "Pull a model from Ollama.com"
4. Choose from available models like llama2, deepseek-coder, etc.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Process 5 unread emails using Claude (default)
python main.py
```

### Command Line Options

```bash
# Process 10 unread emails
python main.py --limit 10

# Use ChatGPT instead of Claude
python main.py --summarizer chatgpt

# Process emails from a specific folder
python main.py --folder "Newsletters"

# Save summaries to a custom directory
python main.py --output-dir "my_summaries"

# Use local Ollama model
python main.py --summarizer ollama

# Mark processed emails as read
python main.py --mark-as-read

# See all available options
python main.py --help
```

### Output

The program will create markdown files in the specified output directory (default: `summaries/`). Each summary file includes:

- YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Markdown-formatted summary of the newsletter content
- Files are named using the date and subject of the email

## Testing

### Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run all tests
python -m pytest
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
python -m pytest --cov=.
```

### Test Organization

- Tests are located in the `__tests__` directory
- Each module has a corresponding test file with the naming convention `test_*.py`
- Test discovery is configured in `pytest.ini`

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Run a specific test file
python -m pytest __tests__/test_html_extractor.py

# Run a specific test class
python -m pytest __tests__/test_summarizer.py::TestClaudeSummarizer

# Run a specific test method
python -m pytest __tests__/test_summarizer.py::TestClaudeSummarizer::test_summarize_success
```

### Example Usage

You can also run the example code in each module directly:

```bash
python html_extractor.py
python email_processor.py
python summarizer.py
python summary_writer.py
```
