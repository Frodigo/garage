## Teaching My Son to Program

I wanted to teach my son how to write code. What I did so far was not interesting to him too much. Actually it was boring. But I don't give up (yet).

## Decluttering

At the end of last year I did an experiment with decluttering and I was happy with the results. I want to go a little further with this and do a total decluttering of both my digital and physical space, which involves getting rid of unnecessary things like subscriptions (detooling) on ​​the one hand and things I don't use on the other.

## Master's degree studies

About 10 years ago I finished my engineering studies and then I couldn't continue and go to master's studies. Now I can and I started studies in "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning".

## Garage project

I love open source and also I enjoy learning and do experiments.

So far I pushed my experiments on my local computer, or on private GitHub repositories.

But I realized that I can connect my love to open source projects and experiments by creating one public project where I keep all my code and notes.

This is how the [garage](https://github.com/Frodigo/garage) project is started.

## Describe AI usage in my project and website

In last 2 years I experimented a lot with AI tools. To be honest with my readers

I want to describe how I use AI. I want to create something like [this](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto)

## Removing multi-language support from my website

I tried to write content in Polish and English, but it's time consuming.

I will use my time to do more experiments than translating content.

Because of that I decided that I will continue writing only in English and

I will remove all Polish content and code responsible for rendering it from my blog.

## NitroDigest project

I create a tool for developers that summaries emails. It works on local machine and uses Ollama under the hood, so it's completely free and emails are processed on localhost.

The prototype can already pull unread mail via IMAP, feed it to a local Llama model, and spit out a tidy Markdown summary.

I am close to have working prototype. Project is open source (it's here: [https://github.com/Frodigo/garage/tree/main/tools/NitroDigest](https://github.com/Frodigo/garage/tree/main/tools/NitroDigest))

I look for contributors. Maybe you?
