I use AI as a tool for research, review, and _limited_ content/code assistance, but prioritize human creation and understanding.

## Content

I use AI to research, review and improve content, and I don't generate complete drafts with AI.

However, I occasionally use AI to draft READMEs or translate Polish content, always with significant editing.

I mark any content drafted or generated by AI with the hashtag #AIGeneratedContent.

I primarily use Ollama. You can find my custom models [here](https://github.com/Frodigo/garage/tree/main/Projects/Testtrack/Cinquecento%20-%20Ollama%20models).

## Code

I use AI as my assistant for writing code. I brainstorm ideas, looking for information, ask for review and sometimes generate some code to see how something can be done.

Sometimes I generate code with AI, but I review and refactor it to meet my standards rather than commit it to the repo directly.
