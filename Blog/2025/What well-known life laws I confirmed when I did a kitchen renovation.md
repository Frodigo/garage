title: What well-known life laws I confirmed when I did a kitchen renovation
---
Some time ago I decided to renovate my kitchen instead of hiring professionals, promising my wife I could handle it. During the renovation, I experienced three classic laws in action:

1. **Murphy's Law** - "If anything can go wrong, it will." I discovered the last box of tiles contained the wrong type just before finishing.
2. **Yhprum's Law** - "Everything that can work, will work." A furniture installer said they could mount furniture before tile completion, which seemed strange but supposedly would work (it didn't, actually).
3. **Parkinson's Law** - "Work expands to fill the time available." Weeks later, the kitchen remains "almost finished" with small tasks still pending.

The best from this story is I survived.
