title: How I failed at writing a blog many times and what I would do differently if I could turn back time

Iâ€™ve been trying to write a blog for many years. I published my first post back in 2017. By now, I wish I could say Iâ€™m a good writer with hundreds of posts behind me.

But the reality is different. In this article, Iâ€™ll share the mistake I kept repeating â€” and what I wish I had done differently if I could turn back time.

## TL;DR

Programmers who want to be writers should focus on writing, not on endlessly rebuilding their blog platforms.

If I could turn back time, Iâ€™d stop chasing the perfect blog setup and just write. Reinventing the wheel was a great excuse to avoid the hard part: writing.

## My first steps into the trap

My first blog was a WordPress site written in Polish â€” a solid choice to get started. The quality of my content wasnâ€™t great, but I enjoyed it. I felt like I was making progress, and each new post was a little better than the last.

## Chasing performance, losing Purpose

A few years later, I worked on a project using React and Next.js â€” and I was impressed. I thought, _why not build my blog with it and fully customize the experience?_

What could go wrong?

I spent weeks crafting my shiny new blog platform. Then more weeks importing posts from WordPress. I even chose Storyblok as a headless CMS. It was a big re-platforming effort, and during that time, I wasnâ€™t writing anything new.

I believed that a Next.js blog would be blazing fast and score perfectly in PageSpeed Insights. And it did.

But now I know: the most important part of a blog is the content â€” not whether it gets a score of 100 or 45.

Honestly, I never even finished implementing all the features I had planned. After a few months, I realized it wasnâ€™t as good as Iâ€™d hoped.

Writing on WordPress was easier.

## Wordpress again

After failing with my custom setup, I decided to go back to WordPress â€” which meant more weeks spent on yet another migration.

This time, I also set up a multilingual platform. I thought I could write in both Polish and English at the same time.

It kind of worked. But I quickly realized it wasnâ€™t as easy as I had imagined. Instead of focusing on writing good content, I was spending my energy on translating.

(Later, I started using AI for that â€” but thatâ€™s another story.)

I should have resisted the hype and shiny new tech â€” but I didnâ€™t.

Every new tool fascinated me, and I kept running away from what truly mattered: improving my writing and actually writing.

Instead, I jumped from one technology to another like a man possessed.

## Go away from WordPress again and migrate to Astro

Then I met astro.build and I was fascinated. I thought that a static website with Markdown as an engine for content is a good idea (and of course it is).

I migrated to Astro. I spent a lot of time because this time I thought that I needed to use this re-platforming opportunity to create a beautiful blog. It was kinda beautiful.

I was really satisfied with this implementation. I wrote more about this here: [https://medium.com/gitconnected/how-and-why-i-moved-my-blog-from-wordpress-to-astro-and-markdown-3549672d5a86](https://medium.com/gitconnected/how-and-why-i-moved-my-blog-from-wordpress-to-astro-and-markdown-3549672d5a86)

Writing in Markdown is perfect. I also started using Obsidian. I could focus more on writing. Anyway, I still used a lot of my time on improving the blog platform, refactoring, adding new features, optimizing, etc.

## The AHA moment

In February, after a 10-year break from engineering studies, I started my masterâ€™s degree.

During one of the first lectures, something the lecturer said made something click in my head.

It was a Saturday, already late â€” around 6 p.m. We were sitting in a small classroom, everyone visibly tired. The kind of moment where youâ€™d expect nothing meaningful to happen.

And yet, thatâ€™s exactly when it did.

The lecturer was an older professor with a sharp sense of humor. His shirt peeked out from under a worn sweater, and his piercing gaze made you pay attention.

There was something about him â€” calm, thoughtful, quietly commanding.

What truly stayed with me was something he said during that lecture. He spoke slowly and clearly about what awaits every student: the masterâ€™s thesis.

He said something like this (Iâ€™m paraphrasing):

> _If your masterâ€™s thesis is truly good, you can write it by hand with a pen â€” and your supervisor will copy it himself, because heâ€™ll know itâ€™s worth the effort._
> _But if your work is weak, even if it looks beautiful and polished, no one will care._

This is a very interesting point of view. It may be obvious, but it made me reflect on how I approach writing.

I thought, do I really want to be a writer, or am I just pretending?

## Facing the truth about my writing

It was hard to face the truth: I hadnâ€™t been focusing on the right thing.

At one point, I even asked myself â€” _maybe writing isnâ€™t for me? Maybe Iâ€™m just pretending?_

Still, I gave myself another chance.

Soâ€¦ what did I do?

Replatformed again. ðŸ˜…

This time, I ditched the beautiful Astro website and went back to basics. I stuck with Markdown and write in Obsidian.

Now, Obsidian is my writing engine. My website is plain â€” some might even call it ugly. But I donâ€™t care.

Iâ€™m finally focusing on what matters: **writing**.

So now Iâ€™m writing â€” and Iâ€™ve made a deal with myself: no replatforming for the next year.

Just writing.

Can I stick to it?

Weâ€™ll see.
