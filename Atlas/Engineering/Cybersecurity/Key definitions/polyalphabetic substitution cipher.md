A cryptographic method that uses multiple substitution alphabets to encrypt plaintext.

In [monoalphabetic rotation ciphers](Monoalphabetic%20rotation%20ciphers.md) each letter in the [plaintext](Plaintext.md) is always substituted with the same letter in [ciphertext](Ciphertext.md)
In a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, substitution depends on the position of the letter and a key.

This makes polyalphabetic substitution ciphers more secure.
