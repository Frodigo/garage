### 1. Fuel‑consumption analysis

- **Description:** Suppose you have a list (or a CSV file) with fuel‑consumption data under different driving conditions (e.g., city, highway, mixed). Write a program that:

  1. Reads the consumption data (e.g., a list called `liters_per_100km`).
  2. Calculates average, maximum and minimum consumption.
  3. Displays the results in a readable way (e.g., “Average consumption is 7.2 l/100 km”).

- **Extension:** Also convert l/100 km values to MPG (miles per gallon).
