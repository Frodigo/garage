This is a learning roadmap for anyone who want to be a ML Engineer. I created it from perspective of full-stack developer with no experience with ML and Python. Goals I had in mind when I created this roadmap

## Level 0: Python & math essentials _<-- I am here_

**Goal:** Learn just enough Python and math to understand and write ML code.

### Topics

- [Python basics (variables, functions, loops, classes, data structures, testing)](./level-0-python-and-math-essentials/python-tutorial-notes.ipynb) ✅
- [NumPy](./level-0-python-and-math-essentials/numpy/numpy-essentials.md) ✅
- pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Basic linear algebra, probability, statistics

### Mini-projects

- [Basic Python Programs](./level-0-python-and-math-essentials/basic-python-programs/README.md)
- Text Analyzer — show list comprehensions, lambda functions, text operations
- Task Manager CLI app — mix object-oriented and procedural styles
- Backup Automation Script — work with files and directories
- Calculator for stats — demonstrate NumPy and descriptive statistics
- Weather App — connect to a weather API and show JSON parsing
- CSV/PDF Report Generator — automate report formatting
- Note Manager GUI — use Tkinter for building a visual tool
- Random Test Data Generator — generate data for testing other projects

### Resources

- [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) ✅🏁💯
- [A Byte of Python" free online book](https://python.swaroopch.com)
- [Obey the Testing Goat!" free online book](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html#toc)
- [Crafting Test-Driven Software with Python: Write test suites that scale with your applications' needs and complexity using Python and PyTest](https://www.amazon.com/Crafting-Test-Driven-Software-Python-applications-ebook/dp/B08PP4FT2B)

## Level 1: your first ML project

**Goal:** Build a full beginner ML pipeline using a structured dataset.

### Topics

- What is ML? Types of learning
- ML pipeline: data → model → prediction
- Scikit-learn: train/test split, fit, predict
- Evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix

### Mini-projects

- Predict flower species (Iris)
- Classify Titanic survivors
- Build a spam email detector
- Automate markdown summaries from email text (custom dataset)
- Use CLI tool to classify text (combine ML + CLI app)

---

## Level 2: Data Understanding & Feature Engineering

**Goal:** Learn to explore and clean datasets, and create useful features.

### Topics

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature types, missing values, outliers
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalization, standardization

### Mini-projects

- Clean and analyze a housing dataset
- Feature engineer from scraped product prices
- Analyze financial data with pandas and visualize trends
- Web scraper for products — collect training data yourself

---

## Level 3: Algorithms and models

**Goal:** Understand how different ML algorithms work and when to use them.

### Topics

- Supervised: Logistic regression, Decision Trees, k-NN, SVM
- Unsupervised: Clustering (k-means), Dimensionality Reduction
- Model selection, bias/variance tradeoff

### Mini-projects

- Compare models (logistic vs. tree vs. SVM)
- Tune a Decision Tree and explain feature splits
- Cluster product prices and show in 2D plot
- Create a template engine with test case generator to explore logic programming

---

## Level 4: Model tuning & evaluation

**Goal:** Learn how to optimize your models and avoid overfitting.

### Topics

- Cross-validation
- Grid search and random search
- ROC curves, AUC, F1 score
- Overfitting and underfitting detection

### Mini-projects

- Tune spam detector with grid search
- Build a multithreaded file downloader that logs performance
- Apply window functions to time series of sensor or stock data
- Create a basic unit test framework to wrap your pipelines

---

## Level 5: Build your own ML tool

**Goal:** Apply ML to a real problem with a full end-to-end solution.

### Topics

- Problem scoping and framing
- Data collection and cleaning
- Deployment basics (e.g. Flask, Streamlit)
- Communicating results and business value

### Mini-projects

- Streamlit app: sentiment analyzer or price predictor
- Flask API for ML model serving
- Django mini blog with prediction plugin
- AI-powered chatbot with basic NLP features

---

## Level 6: Deep Learning Foundations

**Goal:** Dive into neural networks and build intuition for deep models.

### Topics

- Perceptron, activation functions, backpropagation
- Keras/TensorFlow for building neural networks
- CNNs and RNNs intro

### Mini-projects

- Digit classifier with MNIST
- Image classifier for product categories
- RNN-based sentiment analysis
- Intro chatbot with sequence modeling
- Experiment with simple AI modules in games

---

### Level 7: Real-World ML & next steps

**Goal:** Expand your skills and apply ML to domains of interest.

### Topics

- Transfer learning, pre-trained models
- ML in production (monitoring, updating models)
- Ethics and bias in ML
- Optional: NLP, recommender systems, time series

### Mini-projects

- Reuse pretrained models from Hugging Face or TensorFlow Hub
- Build a monitoring system for API predictions
- Explore transformer summarization on email thread dataset
- Create a lightweight dashboard that tracks ML metrics
