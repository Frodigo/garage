## **FROM THE DIRECTOR'S DESK**

Dear Climate Champions,

Spring is here, and with it comes renewed energy for our mission. This month marks the **5th anniversary** of Climate Action Now, and I couldn't be prouder of what our community has accomplished. Together, we've helped implement renewable energy projects in 27 communities, planted over 50,000 trees, and successfully advocated for climate-friendly policies in 12 municipalities.

But our work is far from done. The latest IPCC report highlights that we're at a critical juncture, and the next three years will largely determine whether we can limit warming to 1.5Â°C. That's why we're scaling up our efforts and launching our most ambitious campaign yet: **Project Green Future**.

With gratitude and determination,

*Dr. Elena Rodriguez*
*Executive Director*

## **CAMPAIGN SPOTLIGHT: Project Green Future**

> "The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it." - Robert Swan

Our new flagship initiative aims to accelerate community-level climate action through three interconnected strategies:

1. **Community Solar Co-ops**: Helping neighborhoods establish their own renewable energy projects
2. **Climate-Smart Schools**: Supporting educational institutions in reducing emissions and teaching climate literacy
3. **Local Policy Accelerator**: Equipping citizen advocates with tools to advance climate policies

**We need your help!** Join our virtual launch event on May 15th at 7 PM ET to learn how you can get involved. [Register here](https://register.here)

## **SUCCESS STORY: Riverdale Community Solar**

The Riverdale neighborhood in Portland has just completed its community solar installation, powering 120 homes with clean energy. This project, which began as a conversation at one of our community workshops last year, is now generating 350 kW of solar power and saving residents an average of $240 annually on electricity bills.

What makes this project special is how it prioritized accessibility: 30% of the solar capacity is reserved for low-income households, and the installation provided paid apprenticeships to six local youth.

"I never thought solar would be an option for me," says resident Maria Jenkins. "This program has not only reduced my bills but made me feel part of something bigger."

## **SUPPORTER SPOTLIGHT**

This month we celebrate the contributions of **Green Valley High School's Environmental Club**. These dedicated students organized a community e-waste collection event that properly recycled over 3 tons of electronic waste, and their advocacy led to their school board committing to carbon neutrality by 2030.

"We wanted to show that young people can lead meaningful climate action," says club president Zoe Williams.
