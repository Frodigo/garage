In this document I want to show you ho process and summarize email newsletters using NitroDigest in combination with **Himalaya**, a command-line email client.
## Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need:

```

## Basic Email Processing Workflow

### Step 1: List Unread Emails

Start by viewing your unread newsletters and emails:

```bash

```

**Example output:**

Choose an email to process and save it to a file:

```bash
# Read email by ID and save to markdown file
himalaya message read 1823 > message.md
```

### Step 3: Generate Summary

Create a summary of the email content:

```bash
# Generate summary to separate file

# Or append summary to the original email file
nitrodigest --input message.md >> message.md
```
