## Goals

- [x] package nitrodigest and publish it to PyPi

## Notes

- used setuptools and wheel for building and packaging
- PyPi provides a test package repository
- when I publish the very first version, it was broken because of wrong modules configuration inside the nitrodigest
- I did large refactor and fixed issues
- Also I simplified the configuration, from now nitrodigest tool works OOTB without any config customization
- Nitrodigest is available here: <https://github.com/Frodigo/garage/pull/144>
