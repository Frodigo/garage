## Goals

- [ ] create a very first documentation for NitroDigest

## Notes

- I used Chat GPT research to read more about writing docs best practices
- result of that was a draft of structure for docs
- I created a template of docs page that is used when I create a new page under NitroDigest/docs directory in Obsidian
- I decided that docs will be a part of my website to simplify the process.
- Added content for the Contributing section
- Added content for Getting started section
- Did a research about how to summarize web pages and how to read emails from terminal
	- <https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya> is a pretty interesting options for emails
	- alternative: <https://notmuchmail.org/>
	- I also found this <https://aerc-mail.org/>  which I want to explore as a email client for terminal.
- Also did a research about Slack API and Slack CLI
- Wrote guide for [Summarizing a Single File](Summarizing%20a%20Single%20File.md)
- Wrote a guide for [Summarizing All Files in a Directory](Summarizing%20All%20Files%20in%20a%20Directory.md)
- Created a new issue for implementing a progress bar <https://github.com/Frodigo/garage/issues/157>
- Created a new issue for implementing error handling for processing multiple files <https://github.com/Frodigo/garage/issues/158>
