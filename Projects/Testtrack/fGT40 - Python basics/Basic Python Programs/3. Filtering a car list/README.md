## 3. Filtering a car list by CO₂ emissions

- **Description:** You have a list of car models and their CO₂ emissions (g/km). Write a program that:

  1. Reads data such as `[("ModelA", 120), ("ModelB", 95), ("ModelC", 140), …]`.
  2. Allows the user to enter a maximum permitted emission value (e.g., 100 g/km).
  3. Returns a list of models that do not exceed this value.

- **Extension:** Sort the results ascending by emissions or add a second criterion (e.g., engine power).
