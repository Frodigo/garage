## 4. Reading engine‑temperature logs

- **Description:** You have a file `engine_temps.txt` that stores engine temperatures (°C) every 10 seconds, one temperature per line.
  - Write a program that:
    1. Reads the entire file.
    2. Counts and displays:
       - the number of entries (how many measurements),
       - the average temperature,
       - the highest and lowest recorded temperatures.
  - **Extension:** Show a warning if the highest temperature exceeds a set threshold (e.g., 120 °C).
