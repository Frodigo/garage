Test track is a place where I learn new technologies and do experiments.

For fun I name the projects here using references to different cars. We are in a garage, right?

Projects:

1. [f125rally- MySQL database for university](./f125rally-%20MySQL%20database%20for%20university/README.md)
2. [p911 - Simple eCommerceBackend](./p911%20-%20Simple%20eCommerce%20backend/README.md)
3. [miniS - Algorithms Sandbox](./miniS%20-%20Algoritms%20sandbox/README.md)
