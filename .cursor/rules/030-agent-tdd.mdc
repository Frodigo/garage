# Agent Behavior Rules

1. **Test Execution Protocol**
   - Auto-run tests on file save
   - Suggest minimal fixes for failed tests
   - Generate regression test proposals

2. **Code Generation Controls**
   - Implement only tested functionality
   - Prohibit untested public methods
   - Require null checking for parameters

3. **Refactoring Assistance**
   - Identify code smells using Roslyn analyzers
   - Suggest pattern replacements (e.g., switch to record types)
   - Enforce CA rules during refactoring
