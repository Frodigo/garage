# .NET TDD Patterns

1. **Test Framework Conventions**
   - Use Xunit with [Fact] and [Theory] attributes
   - Test classes must end with "Tests"
   - Follow Given_When_Then test naming

2. **Implementation Patterns**
   - Start with concrete implementations
   - Allow temporary `if` statement chains
   - Prevent premature abstraction

3. **Refactoring Rules**
   - Convert `if` chains to patterns only after 3+ cases
   - Extract methods when duplicate logic appears 3 times
   - Introduce interfaces only after 2 concrete implementations
