# TDD Workflow Enforcement

1. **Red Phase Requirements**
   - New tests must fail before implementation
   - Maximum 1 assertion per test initially
   - Tests must specify behavior, not implementation

2. **Green Phase Constraints**
   - Only make code changes that affect failing tests
   - Allow hardcoded returns for first passing implementation
   - Maximum 3 lines changed per green phase

3. **Refactor Phase Guardrails**
   - Only remove duplication in passing code
   - Preserve all existing behavior
   - Maximum 5 line refactoring steps
